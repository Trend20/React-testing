# Getting Started with Unit Testing in React

Unit testing is the process of testing each individual component in isolation.
It ensures that each functionality that is written achieves the intended goal which in the long run improves the application's performance.

As quoted by Erick Elliotte: "Unit testing is a great discipline, which can lead to 40% - 80% reduction in bug density" 

## How to perform Unit testing of React Apps using JEST?
Jest is a javascript testing framework that allow developers to run unit tests on Javascript and Typescript 
Code and can be easily integrated with React JS.

## Components of a unit test
A test is always written in a test block.
Inside the test block, the first thing is to render the component that we want to test.
Select the elements that we want to interact with.
Interact with those elements.
Assert that the results are s expected.

## Automated testing using Cypress.
Cypress is a next generation frontend testing tool built for modern web. It is mainly used for end to end testing by developers and QA engineers but it can also
be used to test different components independently on the browser.

### Who Uses Cypress?
Cypress is mainly used by developer or QA engineers building web applications using the modern Javascript Frameworks.
It can be used to write all kind of tests:(end to end tests, component tests, integration tests and unit tests)
